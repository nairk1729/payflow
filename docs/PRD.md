# PayFlow — Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## 1. Overview

PayFlow is a lightweight hosted payments platform that enables small businesses to accept payments through simple payment links or embedded checkout components.

The product removes the need for merchants to build or manage custom payment infrastructure, starting with integration via Stripe and evolving toward a provider-agnostic payments orchestration layer.

---

## 2. Problem Statement

Small businesses face significant friction when trying to accept payments:

- Payment setup requires technical knowledge or multiple tools
- Existing solutions are either too complex (full e-commerce platforms) or too limited (basic invoices)
- No simple way to generate reusable payment links quickly
- Limited flexibility across payment providers

**Impact:**
- Delayed payments
- Lost revenue opportunities
- Operational inefficiency

---

## 3. Goals

### Primary Goal
Enable a merchant to:
> Sign up → create a payment link → accept their first payment in under 10 minutes

### Secondary Goals
- Provide a clean, mobile-friendly checkout experience
- Reduce setup friction for non-technical users

---

## 4. Non-Goals (MVP)

---

- RefundPayment()

This enables future support for multiple providers (Stripe, Paytm, etc.)
